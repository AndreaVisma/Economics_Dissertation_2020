# Economics_Dissertation_2020

This repository contains all the necessary materials to replicate my Economics Dissertation.

The folder /MATLAB_code contains the codes used to solve the model used in the disseration on MATLAB. The subfolder /VFI_Toolkit contains the version of Robert Kirby's Value Function Iteration Toolkit used at the time of writing. I uploaded this version here because the Toolkit itself has since been modified and the code I used for the model would not work on the version now available. The subfolder /Italy_Model contains the various part of the code built for the model of the Italian economy. The file 'CPU_Italy_Model' is the core of the model. The other files contain functions that play various roles in the model. The core code is widely commented and explains the references to external functions.
