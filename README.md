# Economics_Dissertation_2020

- This repository contains all the necessary materials to replicate my Economics Dissertation.

- The folder /MATLAB_code contains the codes used to solve the model used in the disseration on MATLAB. 
  -The subfolder /VFI_Toolkit contains the version of Robert Kirby's Value Function Iteration Toolkit used at the time of writing. I uploaded this version here because the Toolkit itself has since been modified and the code I used for the model would not work on the version now available. 
  -The subfolder /Italy_Model contains the various part of the code built for the model of the Italian economy. The file 'CPU_Italy_Model' is the core of the model. The other files contain functions that play various roles in the model. The core code is widely commented and explains the references to external functions.

- The folder \Data contains the data I used to produce original figures and tables, as well as to carry out the calibration exercise.
   - the file 'WID_FR_US_Wealth' contains the data used to produce Figure 3.
   - the file 
   - The subfolder \SHIW_2016 contain the data from the Survey on Households' Income and Wealth of the Bank of Italy. It is the main source of the distributions addressed in the dissertation. There is a .pdf file that explains how to navigate the microdata. Additionally, there is a file that reports cross-sectional summary tables ==> Table 1 & Figure 5
   - The subfolder \TFP contains data on the international comparison of total factor productivity ==> Figure 6
   - The subfolder \Calibration contains the data on the calibration of the model. Each file addresses a different part of the process.
